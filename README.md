## 🗺️ Roadmap

📊 Pyramiding Calculator (Coming Soon – part of Advanced Risk Management)
A layered scaling tool that models position growth across multiple entries with fixed or dynamic risk increments. Tracks each layer’s entry price, quantity, risk/reward, and cumulative exposure in a structured table. Designed for conviction-based compounding, real-time recalibration, and seamless integration with your strategy setup for disciplined execution.

📊 Dashboard Refinement (In Progress)
Enhancing the dashboard with more granular filters, improved performance metrics, and semantic feedback. Updates include better time-period analysis, grouped trade insights, and smoother selector logic for real-time responsiveness.

⚙️ Settings Panel Upgrade (In Progress)
Refactoring the settings UI for clarity and control. Improvements include broker connection validation, dynamic kill-switch toggles, and contextual tooltips to guide users through risk configuration and API setup
